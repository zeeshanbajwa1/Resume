		{Switching}
		{LAN Managed Switches for 1600 Branches for National Bank of Pakistan}
		{Oct 2023}
		{%Dummy text 
        The project encompasses the procurement and meticulous configuration of LAN Managed Switches, specifically the S5735 series. It involves the acquisition of these switches followed by a detailed setup adhering to specific security measures and network configurations. This encompasses setting up user authentication, SSH access, VLAN configurations, port security, routing, network services like NTP, and comprehensive logging for monitoring and auditing purposes. Additionally, it includes the implementation of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for network stability and SNMP for effective network management. The project's successful execution ensures a fortified network infrastructure through stringent security measures and efficient management configurations. It delivers a meticulously configured network of LAN Managed Switches (S5735 series) that adhere to the provided specifications, enhancing the overall security, efficiency, and manageability of the network infrastructure. The documented configurations and setup facilitate future troubleshooting, maintenance, and network expansion.}

		{Routing}
		{Punjab Public Service Commission}
		{June 2023}
		{%Dummy text 
        Project for the Punjab Public Service Commission to establish a robust and secure network to connect PPSC's locations in Pakistan. It improved communication and data sharing between their Islamabad, Lahore, and Multan offices. All 4 sites achieved successful connectivity, ensuring smooth communication and data transfer. The network had high availability and redundancy for minimal downtime and efficient traffic handling. BGP enabled connectivity with external networks for secure data exchange with trusted partners. Additionally, OSPF was implemented for LAN side connectivity in all four branches, including two in Lahore (1 aggregate and 1 branch), one in Islamabad, and one in Multan.}
	\entry
		{Network Security}
		{LSS School Systems Network Security Project}
		{Feb 2023}
		{%Dummy text 
        A comprehensive network security strategy was implemented, employing Fortigate 601F and Cisco ASA firewalls. The primary aim was to fortify the network infrastructure to meet stringent security demands. The Fortigate 601F was configured as the primary defense, offering advanced threat protection, intrusion prevention, SSL inspection, and secure remote access. It was optimized for efficient traffic management through policy-based and dynamic routing. Meanwhile, the Cisco ASA served as a secondary firewall, mirroring the primary's security capabilities and supporting site-to-site and remote access VPN functionalities. Both systems were meticulously fine-tuned to work harmoniously, ensuring maximum security and uninterrupted availability. The project also involved creating comprehensive security policies to govern the appropriate use and administration of these firewalls.}
    \entry
		{Infra Deployment}
		{Hired International Pvt Ltd Networking Project}
		{June 2022}
		{%Dummy text 
        A comprehensive networking project was completed, involving the deployment and pre-configuration of Cisco 2960, 3550, and 3560 switches, alongside the setup of a CCTV system with 32 IP cameras and a Hikvision NVR. To streamline network management, a Microtic CCR1009 Core cloud router with auto-failover, load balancing, and a built-in firewall was employed. Additionally, an Omada wireless controller 300 and multiple Tplink Archer 3600 access points were installed for seamless wireless connectivity. The primary goal was to establish a reliable, secure, and high-performance network infrastructure, with each component carefully chosen and configured to achieve these objectives.}
